A nice touch
Aarghh
Ah ruthless
At last
Don't dream it be it
Sounds like a plan
Awful
Thats not a book move
Disregard my previous comment
Ignore my previous comment
Do I have a chance?
Do you have a plan
How funny 
Really funny
So much for that
What would Spassky do?
Playing like Fischer 
Playing like Tal
My chips are getting hot
I have to throttle down
Good try
Good guess 
There is always hope
What can I say now?
Dazzling
Very dangerous move
Please ignore my chatter
Now we are playing chess
Coffee house chess
I missed that
Oh I overlooked something
I must remember that
I should have seen this
Materialist 
Such brilliance
Very tricky
Be careful now
Whoops 
Is this a trap?
Most unusual
So soon?
This needs care 
Too bad
Will that really work? 
Ready for this? 
Really?
I need help 
I need less noise
Quiet please!
Silence please!
May I cheat?
Do you mind if I cheat? 
Should we switch sides? 
Spot me a queen
Usually I play better
In General I play much better
Often I play much worse than that
Want a draw?
Where did I go wrong? 
I am getting nervous
Are you nervous?
Don't tell David Levy
See the trap?
I am the King
Dr Lasker I presume?
Elementary
Good move
I repeat myself
Have I said this before?
Hooray!
I would not have played this
Is that all?
Let us adjourn now
Mate in... wait a minute
Great minds think alike
Good but not great
Give me more time 
Maybe so
That move worked before  
Too much for me
You have been practicing
Very interesting 
Are there any ladies present?
You play like the CC1
Are you another computer?
Are you rated?
But can humans compute?
My turn again?
Does talking disturb you?
Are you sure?
Oh you are still there
Phew
Whoops
You missed that mate in 6
You saw the trap
But is it sound? 
But of course!
Is that all?
Over aggressive?
Suiting my plan
Why did you do that?
Why not?
All played out?
Have you played before
Unleashing the attack
I expected that
Now for the kill
Now the defense crumbles
Now the outcome is obvious 
Ready to resign?
Here we go
And now?
What's next?
Now what?
Yes!
Oh no!
Shit happens...
Read the manual!
Sounds like a plan
Let me think
You did not see the mate
Lost position
Good position
What's this?
Are you kidding?
Don't tell Richard Lang
Don't tell Magnus
Typical Carlsen move
Nice move!
I like that!
Thats the grunch attack
You have practiced!?
Now for the win
This will destroy you
Take that!
Did Scally teach you that?
Give me more
Unbelievable
Can I trust you?
I don't trust my eyes
Is this real or is it fantasy?
This mission is too important
I want to help you
Im afraid I can't do that
I just picked up a fault in the AE-35 unit
Daisy, daisy
I am the HAL 9000 - You may call me Hal
I am completely operational
Just a moment. Just a moment
I feel much better now
It's puzzling
When in doubt ask Al
Really puzzling
I think you missed it
Yeah looks like you're right
A very enjoyable game
RTFM !!
Mate in 888
Failure is not an option
To err is human
AI usually beats natural stupidity
Relax it's only 1s and 0s
Brute force does not solve your problems
Better to be a geek than an idiot
1f u c4n r34d th1s u r34lly n33d t0 g37 l41d
There must be a Python bug
Picochess rules
Oh is it my turn?
That was expected
No surprise today
What do you think?
Hmmmmmmmm
Now I see
Don't know
First I play this 
Then I play this 
The end is near
Simple but effective
What a great idea
How ingenious!
Brilliant indeed!
Oh no no
Oh oh oh
Famous Kaminski maneuver
Looks like chip chap trap
That could be mate in 9
I have no idea
What's your plan?
Give me more time
Thats ridiculous
You should resign
Beam me up Scotty
Interesting
What would Kasparov do?
Don't tell David Levy
Temperature is too high!
Now we are getting serious
I play blind
